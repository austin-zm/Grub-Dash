# Grub-Dash - In this class project I've been hired as a back-end developer for a new startup called GrubDash!
As another developer works on the design and front-end experience, I've have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that
the front-end developers demo out some initial design ideas to the big bosses.
